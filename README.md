## 🎯 Business Problem

The business generates large volumes of sales data but lacks a clear and visual understanding of sales performance across categories, regions, customers, and time.  
This makes it difficult for stakeholders to identify trends, compare performance, and make data-driven decisions.

This project addresses that problem by providing **visual insights** using R.
